    <h2 class="center">Formula 1</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of
      international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars
      sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile(FIA). The race
      gives the audience and the team a thrilling, intense, and nerve-wracking
      experience, making it one of my favourite things to watch over the
      weekends.

    <h2 class="center">Badminton</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I also have a passion for Badminton. The speed of the game and the
      reaction speed needed creates a feeling of satisfaction and a mental
      relief when I play the game. Another reason why I enjoy the game is, your
      always learning something new when you play and it isn't always the same
      as the last one you played

    <h2 class="center">Travelling</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Whenever I have time I'm usually travelling to places inside or outside of
      Edmonton and Canada. I really enjoy travelling because of all the new
      experiences and all the new things I can try and learn in those new
      places. I've been to London, Singapore, India, The United States, and a
      few other places around the world.
